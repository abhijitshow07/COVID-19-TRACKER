<h2>Abstract</h2>
<h4>Covid-19 has put the world to a standstill. Doctors, healthcare workers and personnel of many other essential services are fighting at the frontline to tackle this global pandemic. Although we are not fighting the battle at the frontline, as students of statistics this is our humble attempt at partaking in the struggle.<br><br>
Here we have displayed the data from the world as a whole and also country wise.The data is categorised into three componenets: confirmed cases, deaths and recovered. The values are given for both daily and cumulative type.We have tried our best to keep the display simple yet visually appealing. We have used line charts and pie charts and also an exquisite race chart for display.All the above mentioned charts are interactive and are customized to give the user a clear idea of the intended meaning of the values as all the the categories are separated by different colours,this not only made the graphs more appealing to the eyes but also helped in distinguishing different aspects. There are two sections dedicated to graphs, one for India and the other for the entire world, graphs for India are under Graphs under India Tracker and those for the world are under Graphs under Home. The entire site is designed to make it as user friendly as possible. Our source for global data is Johns Hopkins University, to access the data <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">click here</a> and to access the data for India <a href="https://covid19india.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br><br>
We didn't just stop at displaying the data but went ahead and made predictions for values of total confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for both India and the world. We obtained our predictions by using a Facebook Prophet model. Facebook Prophet is an excellent time series model developed by Facebook. It is fast and simple it also automatically takes into account the crucial time points in the data provided. Using this model, we have obtained appreciable accuracy in India predictions and excellent accuracy in world predictions. The predictions are displayed under Predictions.<br><br>
Our joys would know no bounds if our humble effort comes of any use to anyone battling this global pandemic. It is our utmost desire that we overcome this situation with unity and fraternity.</h4>
